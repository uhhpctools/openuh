Installing Open64
=================


Introduction
------------

This document explains how to compile and install Open64 on an IA64/X86_64 
based system. The documentation is split into 5 steps:

    * Prerequisites
    * Obtaining the Source Code
    * Compiling
    * Environment Variables
    * Installation

We encourage you to pay attention to the Prerequisites in order to avoid un-
necessary problems later in the build process. Should you ever encounter any
problems with one of the steps, please take a look in the FAQ, the forum or
leave a comment on our web site http://www.open64.net.


Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile Open64 successfully, you should meet the following 
requirements:

    * Linux based OS
      Currently, Open64 is intensively tested on Linux on IA64/X86_64/IA32.

    * IA64/X86_64/IA32 based machine
      In this release, Open64 is supported and tested for the Itanium 2 and  
      X86_64 architectures. Itanium 1 and generic IA32 is also supported, but 
      not tested carefully.

    * GNU Make
      You should use a up to date version of Make. Unfortunately the current GNU
      Make version 3.81, which is shipped with the latest Linux distributions,
      causes some trouble--this version leads to a Makefile error. To solve this
      problem, just run the Makefile again and the error will not appear. To 
      avoid this error, please install GNU Make version 3.80. This version has 
      been tested and works with our Makefile.

    * GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
      In order to compile the Open64 source code, you need GCC 3.2.x - 3.4.x. 
      Support for GCC 2.x has been dropped since release 1.0 and is not yet 
      available for GCC 4.x. If you don't have any of the suggested GCC versions
      above, we recommend that you to install GCC 3.4.6.
      Open64 has been tested and successfully compiled with GCC 3.3.x and 3.4.x.

    * IFC (Intel Fortran Compiler)
      To compile and use the Open64 Fortran compiler, you need to install the 
      Intel Fortran Compiler. A free version for noncommercial use is available
      from Intel.
      (http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/download/download/index.htm)
      
      Depending on the path where you have installed IFC, you may have to adapt
      the Open64 Makefile. Please go to open64/kpro64/linux/make/gcommondefs and
      check the defines for F90 and F90_RTLIBS and adjust them if necessary. 
      Please also add the path to the IFC libraries to your library path.
        
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/IFC/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

      To build the Fortran Compiler, another environment INTEL_COMPILER_FC_HOME
      is also needed. Please set it to the home directory of the IFC.

        export INTEL_COMPILER_FC_HOME=/path/to/IFC


Obtaining the Source Code
-------------------------

To compile Open64 you need to obtain the source code first.

There are two ways:

    * Obtain the Source Code as Archive
      You can download the source code from Sourceforge.net
      You will find the links to the different versions in our download section.
      (http://www.open64.net/download.html)

      You have to obtain the source code and the prebuild libraries/binaries!

      Extract the source code and the prebuild binaries/libraries
        
        tar xzf open64-4.0.tar.gz
        tar xzf open64-4.0-prebuild.tar.gz

    * Obtain the Source Code from our Subversion Repository
      You can also obtain the latest version of our source code from the sub-
      version repository.
      To get the latest version issue the following command:
        
        svn co http://svn.open64.net/svnroot/open64/branches/OpenUH/

      This will copy the latest code to the directory open64.

      You can also surf through our subversion repository online.
      (http://svn.open64.net)

      You also need to obtain the prebuild libraries/binaries and extract them 
      to the root directory of the Open64 source code.


Compiling
---------

Switch to the Open64 directory and execute the following command:
  
  gmake all

If you want to build a debugable version of Open64, please use the following 
command:

  gmake all BUILD_OPTIMIZE=DEBUG


Environment Variables
---------------------

Before the installation, and later when you want use Open64, the environment 
variable TOOLROOT should always be set. If the TOOLROOT is not set, a path 
will be prompted during installation.

Depending on whether you are root or a user add the following lines to your 
/etc/bashrc or ~/.bashrc:

  export TOOLROOT=/opt/open64 or
  export TOOLROOT=/home/{user name}/local/open64 or
  export TOOLROOT=/somewhere/you/have/write/permission
 
This defines where to install the Open64 and where later Open64 has to search 
for libraries and binaries.

You should also add the Open64 binary directory to you path.

  export PATH=$TOOLROOT/bin:$PATH
 
Don't forget to source your updated .bashrc file.

  source ~/.bashrc
 
Warning!!!
If you have more the one version of Open64 installed, be aware of the following 
fact:
Lets assume that one version is installed in /opt/open64-1 and the other in 
/opt/open64-2 and that your TOOLROOT is set to /opt/open64-1. Now, even if you 
start Open64 in /opt/open64-2, it will execute Open64 in /opt/open64-1 because 
the TOOLROOT is set to this directory.


Installation
------------

We are almost done. Now, you have just to start the install script and Open64 
will be installed in the directory defined by the environment variable TOOLROOT.

  make install

Congratulations. You have succsessfully installed Open64. Have fun.


Note: to compile OpenMP C/C++ programs, you need to use -gnu3 to enable the GNU 3.3 frontend that supports OpenMP 
directives.
