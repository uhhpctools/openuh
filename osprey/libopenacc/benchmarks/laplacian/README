This application is sensitive to the order of floating point operations.
So to compare the OpenACC result with serial result easily, disable FMA.
This can be done by passing -ta=nvidia,nofma to PGI compiler. 

To commpile with PGI compiler:
> make CC=pgcc

To compile with OpenUH-ACC compiler:
> uhcc -I../../ laplacian.c -fopenacc -v
> ./ptx_compile.sh
> make

To run the program:
> ./run.sh
